---------------------------------------------

 * Introduction

The folder contains Lab02.c. The Lab02.c is the code file that uses Pthreads application for the sorting algorithm.


 * Requirements
In order to run the code files on Ubuntu system, users need to run the right command syntax. Then, users must enter the array size, and input the array numbers respectively as required in the command prompt.The detailed information is given below.

Lab02.c

1.	gcc -pthread Lab02.c (or gcc -pthread Lab02.c -o output_file) 
2.	./a.out (or ./output_file) 
3.	“Enter the array Size” request
4.	User must input a specific integer number for the array size they wish
5.	“Enter an array” request 
6.	User must input the array of numbers 



In these commands above, each part means:
-	gcc is the compiler command
-	-pthread tells the compiler to link in the pthread library as well as configure the compilation for threads
-	Lab02.c is the name of C program source file
-	-o is option to make object file
-	output_file, or a.out is the name of object file


 * Installation
Users need to install Ubuntu on Virtual Machine and know command syntax to run the code files. The command syntax for each part is provided in the “Requirements” part.

* Run MAKEFILE

Run 'make' to compile the code.
It will create an object file named output.

The command line will request the user enters the size of an array and the entire array. It expects and will only accept the positive number for the size of an array. It also expects a valid value for each element of the array.

For example:
-	run make
-	run ./output
-	Enter size of an array “Enter the size of an array: 10”
-	Enter an array “Enter an array: 2 9 7 1 3 9 8 4 0 6”
